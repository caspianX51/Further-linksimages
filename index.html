      <h1>Links e Imagenes</h1>
      <p>When we need to link to another page from our website we use the anchor element</p>
      <p>we do this by using &lt;a&gt; but that only tells our site that we need to anchor something</p>
      <p>we need to tell them that we are using this to refeer to another page so we add <em>href</em></p>
      <p>as an atribute and it would look like this &lt;a href="https://www.google.com &gt;</p>
      <p>and that makes <strong><a href="http://www.google.com"> A link like this!</a></strong></p>

      <h2>Absolute and relative links</h2>
      <p>theres two kinds of links we can use to refeer to another element (page, website, image etc....)</p>
      <p> this are called <strong>absolute</strong> and <strong>relative</strong> links</p>
      <p><em>Absolute links: </em> This are the links that don't change no matter where our document is located, usually because it links to somewhere on</p>
      <p>the web or has a full directory where it should link to for example: </p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">THIS YOUTUBE LINK</a>
      <p>that links directly to the YouTube webpage and most likely it'll never change</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><em>Relative links:</em> This kind  of links are a little more tricky, because this link will only worl if the</p>
      <p>files are located on a specific directory. This is because we use a shoter adress for them, this file </p>
      <p>on these links we asume we are working in the same location so we just need to tell our link wich file we want</p>
      <p>and no the full adress like this image:</p>
      <img src="cat.svg" alt="Gatomeado">
      <p>the code of this image shows like this <em>&lt;img src="cat.svg" alt="gatomeado" &gt;</em></p>
      <p>You can see that the adress is only shown as cat.svg because both files (this html document and the image) are located in</p>
      <p>The same directory </p>
